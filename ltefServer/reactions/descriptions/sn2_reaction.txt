The Sn2 (Substitution bimolecular) reaction results in a nucleophile attacking a carbon with a leaving group, kicking the leaving group out and forming a new carbon-nucleophile bond. The reaction occurs in one step (nucleophile enters and leaving group exits at the same time). The reaction results in an inversion in stereochemistry because the nucleophile has to enter from the opposite side that the leaving group will exit the molecule. For example, if the leaving group is above the plane, the nucleophile will attack the molecule from the bottom. The reaction will occur the fastest for primary halides, slower for secondary halides, and doesn't progress for tertiary halides. This is because of large steric hindrance doesn't allow for the back-side attack.  

The Sn2 reaction competes with the Sn1, E1, and E2 reactions.

This is a substitution reaction in which an atom of bromine replaces a hydrogen atom in an alkane, generating an alkyl bromide and hydrogen bromide. The reaction proceeds by a radical pathway. Reactivity order for the alkane is as follows: tertiary alkanes (most reactive) > secondary alkanes > primary alkanes > methane (least reactive). The reaction also works with fluorine, chlorine, or iodine in place of bromine. The reactivity order for the halogen is as follows: fluorine (most reactive) > chlorine > bromine > iodine (least reactive). Only chlorination and bromination are useful in the laboratory, and bromination is more selective for the alkane that generates the most stable radical intermediate.

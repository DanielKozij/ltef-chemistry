The Corey-Kim oxidation is the oxidation of a primary or secondary alcohol to ultimately produce the corresponding ketone or aldehyde. The reaction utilizes an inimide (N-chlorosuccinimide) to activate the dimethyl sulfide, which acts similar to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to reaction with the alcohol to from the sulfoxide. Addition of base, traditionally triethyl amine, causes the elimination of the sulfane, which ultimately produces the carbonyl. This reaction is very similar to the Swern oxidation, but the Corey-Kim oxidation can be completed at temperatures above -25 degrees Celsius.
